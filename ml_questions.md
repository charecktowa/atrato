It is important to have a basic understanding of Machine Learning algorithms and their
applications. Please answer the following questions:

    a. How would you integrate model training into a CI/CD pipeline?
        - First by keeping track of the code and configuration files using something like git and GitHub.
          Then I would keep track of the data using MLFlow. After that, I would use GitHub Actions to automate
          tests and training of the model. After each training I would keep track of model performance and snapshots.
          When the model is trained and properly evaluated, I would export to ONNX format to help with the inference, 
          then would create an API to serve it and then use Docker to containerize the application. 
          Finally, I would use a service like AWS or Azure to deploy the application.

    b. What steps would you include in an MLOps pipeline (from data ingestion to
    production monitoring)?
        - Data Ingestion: collect, store and keep track of the data.
        - Data Validation: check for missing values, outliers, data types, etc.
        - Data Preprocessing: clean, transform and prepare the data for training.
        - Model Training: train the model.
        - Model Evaluation: evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and cross-validation.
        - Model registration: register the model in a model registry.
        - Model Deployment: deploy the model to production.
        - Monitoring: monitor the model performance and data drift.
        - Retraining: retrain the model when necessary.

    c. How would you handle rollback of a model that failed in production?
        - I would always keep track of the versions and allow a fallback model with the previous version
          to be easily available. I would keep track of model metrics and performance to be able to 
          switch between the current model and the fallback if necessary. And then would investigate the
          issue with the current model and fix it before deploying again.

    d. How would you detect data drift?
        - I would monitor the training data and the production data by their statistical information
          like mean, median, standar deviation, etc. I would monitor periodically the model performance and
          the statistics info. Then with the data I would use statistical tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
          to compare the distributions of the training and production data. If there is a significant difference
          between the two distributions, then there is data drift.
    e. What metrics would you monitor for a production model?
        - Model performance according to the problem (accuracy, precision, F1-score, RMSE, etc, etc.) 
          depending if it is a classification or regression problem
        - Model and data statistics
        - Latency
        - Server usage (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.)
        - Logs and errors while serving the model
